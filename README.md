Here, i will input all of my arduino projects and scripts. Some of them are made in school and they are in name by "Automatika" so you can check it out. New projects are added there every tuesday. Remaining ones can be at any time. There will be a folder which will say changelogs to this repository. The best part is that its actually 𝗙𝗥𝗘𝗘 to download. It may be 𝗢𝗣𝗘𝗡 𝗦𝗢𝗨𝗥𝗖𝗘 in future.Stay active and happy coding!
